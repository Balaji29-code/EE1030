\item The author said, "Musicians rehearse before their concerts. Actors rehearse
their roles before the opening of a new play. On the other hand, I find it
strange that many public speakers think they can just walk on to the stage
and start speaking. In my opinion, it is no less important for public speakers
to rehearse their talks." \\ \\ Based on the above passage, which one of the following is \textbf{TRUE}? \hfill[2021 AE]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The author is of the opinion that rehearsing is important for musicians, actors
and public speakers.
\item The author is of the opinion that rehearsing is less important for public speakers
than for musicians and actors.
\item The author is of the opinion that rehearsing is more important only for
musicians than public speakers.
\item The author is of the opinion that rehearsal is more important for actors than
musicians.
