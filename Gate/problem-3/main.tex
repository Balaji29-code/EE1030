 \textbf{Statement for Linked Answer Questions \ref{54} and \ref{55}} \\
 A solar energy installation utilize a three-phase bridge converter to feed energy into power system through a transformer of $400V/400V$
 as shown below. The energy is collected in a bank of 
 $400V$
 battery and is connected to converter through a large filter choke of resistance $10 \ohm$
