    \item The donor concentration in a sample of $n$-type silicon is increased by a factor
of 100. Assuming the sample to be non-degenerate, the shift in the Fermi
level (in $meV$) at $300 K$ (rounded off to the nearest integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\\ (Given $k_BT = 25 meV$ at $300K$)\hfill [2021 PH]
\item Two observers $O$ and $O^\prime$ observe two events $P$ and $Q$. The observers have a
constant relative speed of $0.5c$. In the units, where the speed of light, $c$, is
taken as unity, the observer $O$ obtained the following coordinates: \\
Event $P$ : $x = 5$, $y = 3$, $z = 5$, $t = 3$ \\
Event $Q$ : $x = 5$, $y = 1$, $z = 3$, $t = 5$\\
The length of the space-time interval between these two events, as measured by $O^\prime$, is $L$. The value of $\abs{L}$ (in integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\hfill [2021 PH]
\item A light source having its intensity peak at the wavelength $289.8 nm$ is
calibrated as $10,000 K$ which is the temperature of an equivalent black body
radiation. Considering the same calibration, the temperature of light source
(in $K$) having its intensity peak at the wavelength $579.6 nm$ (rounded off to
the nearest integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}

\item A hoop of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping along a straight line
on a horizontal surface as shown in the figure. A point mass $m$ slides without
friction along the inner surface of the hoop, performing small oscillations
about the mean position. The number of degrees of freedom of the system
(in integer) is \rule{1.5cm}{0.4pt}

\item Three non-interacting bosonic particles of mass $m$ each, are in a one-
dimensional infinite potential well of width $a$. The energy of the third excited
state of the system is $x \times \frac{h^2 \pi^2}{ma^2}$. The value of $x$ (in integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} 

\hfill [2021 PH]
\item The spacing between two consecutive S- 
branch lines of the rotational Raman
spectra of hydrogen gas is $243. 2 cm^{-1}$
. After excitation with a laser of
wavelength $514.5 cm$, the Stoke's line appeared at $17611.4 cm^{-1}$
for a
particular energy level. The wavenumber (rounded off to the nearest
integer), in $cm^{-1}$
, at which Stoke's line will appear for the next higher energy
level is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\hfill [2021 PH]
\item The transition line, as shown in the figure, arises between $^2D_{\frac{3}{2}}$ and $^2P_\frac{1}{2}$ states without any external magnetic field. The number of
lines that will appear in the presence of a weak magnetic field (in integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt} \hfill [2021 PH]

\item Consider the atomic system as shown in the figure, where the Einstein $A$
coefficients for spontaneous emission for the levels are $A_{2 \to 1} = 2 \times 10^7 s^{-1}$ and $A_{1 \to 0} = 10^8 s^{-1}$. If $10^{14}$ atoms/$cm^3$ are excited from level 0 to level 2 and a steady state population in level 2 is achieved, then the steady state
population at level 1 will be $x \times 10^{13} $
. The value of $x$ (in integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\hfill [2021 PH]

\item If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are constant vectors, $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{p}$ are generalized positions and
conjugate momenta, respectively, then for the transformation $Q = \vec{a}\cdot \vec{p}$ and
$P = \vec{b} \cdot \vec{r}$ to be canonical, the value of $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}$ (in integer) is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}\hfill [2021 PH]

\item In a semiconductor, the ratio of the effective mass of hole to electron is $2:11$
and the ratio of average relaxation time for hole to electron is $1:2$. The ratio
of the mobility of the hole to electron is \hfill [2021 PH]

\item An electromagnetic wave having electric field $E = 8 \cos\brak{{kz - \omega t}} \hat{y}V cm^{-1}$ is incident at $90 \degree$(normal incidence) on a square slab from vacuum (with
refractive index $n_0 = 1.0$) as shown in the figure. The slab is composed of
two different materials with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$. Assume that the
permeability of each medium is the same. After passing through the slab for
the first time, the electric field amplitude, in $V cm^{-1}$, of of the electromagnetic
wave, which emerges from the slab in region 2, is closest to \hfill [2021 PH]
